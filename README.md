# DaggerFlux.jl

This is currently an early stage integration between [`Dagger.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Dagger.jl) and [`Flux.jl`](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) to allow for distributed computation of differentiation pipelines to use multiple workers, devices, GPUs etc.

Contributions welcome to the GitHub repository!
